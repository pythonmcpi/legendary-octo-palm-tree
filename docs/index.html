making it difficult for him to read or write. A little over a year ago, his best friend,
Benny Kilmartin, was found dead at the foot of the tree on which their treehouse was built.
The police investigation, led by <a href="#c-lb">Lieutenant Baird</a>, fails to find the reason
why the treehouse ladder rung broke. Baird doesn't believe that Mason is telling the entire truth.</p><br><p>Mason meets another kid named <a href="#c-cc">Calvin Chumsky</a>. They find out that they
are neighbors, and immediately become best friends. They discover an unused underground cellar
in the orchard, and decide to use it as shelter from <a href="#c-md">a few bullies</a> who chase them after school.
One day, Calvin vanishes while being pursued by the bullies. Mason checks everywhere, but cannot find his friend.
The police are also suspicious about Calvin's disappearance. Is Mason a dangerous murderer, or is it just a coincidence?
</p><br><h1>Meet The Characters</h1><table class="col2"><tr><td><div class="character"><h2 id="c-mb">Mason Buttle</h2><p>Mason is only 12 years old and has learning disabilities, but he is physically large and strong.
He often feels lonely because of his difficulties at school. His family owns many acres of
apple orchards, but the trees are not taken care of and ripe apples are left to rot. Part of the land
was sold to developers to pay the bills. Mason's parents have already passed away, and his uncle
spends all day at a diner. Although Mason gets bullied by Matt and Lance, he also feels sorry for them.
His empathy for others is one of the core themes in the book.</p></div></td><td><div class="character"><h2 id="c-cc">Calvin Chumsky</h2><p>Calvin's family moves into one of the newly built houses. At school, Calvin meets Mason and
they become good friends. Unlike Mason, Calvin is physically smaller and does not have learning
disabilities. Calvin helps Mason investigate Benny's death, suggesting that they make a timeline
to organize things.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="character"><h2 id="c-md">Matt &amp; Lance</h2><p>Matt and Lance are two brothers who bully others that they consider to be weak. Mason is often
targeted because of his learning disability. Calvin is targeted because he is physically small,
and is friends with Mason. Although Matt and Lance bully others for fun, they do not mean to
seriously harm anyone.</p></div></td><td><div class="character"><h2 id="c-lb">Lieutenant Baird</h2><p>Lieutenant Baird is a police officer in charge of investigating Benny's death. He questions Mason's
innocense and thinks that there is more to the story than what Mason is willing to say. He makes regular
visits to Mason's home to try and get more information about the case.
